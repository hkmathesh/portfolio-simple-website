# My Portfolio Website

This is a simple portfolio website built using HTML and basic CSS. The website consists of the following pages:

1. **Home Page**: This page introduces me and provides a brief overview of my skills and interests.
2. **Contact Page**: This page includes a form to reach out to me, along with other contact information.

## Features

- Clean and minimal design
- Easy navigation between pages
- Responsive layout (if applicable)

## How to View the Website

You can visit the website directly at [Your GitHub Pages Link](https://yourusername.github.io/your-repository-name).

## Future Improvements
